Inside this program you raise a Chao.
Point of this game is to have the chaos' happiness go up to 100.
Every action the user takes another stat goes down. For example "feed chao"
increases its belly stat but the potty stat goes down. If any of the stats go all the way
 down to 0 the game ends. The stats that are effected by the actions are randomized and the chao also starts with randomized stats.
By hitting "4", the chao is released if you want to quit the game.
